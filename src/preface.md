# Preface

The landscape of proxy applications has become crowded and fragmented, so—out of personal interest—I decided to consolidate the ones I use into a single stack. The `chimera_client` takes inspiration from the open-source `clash-rs` project, with the long-term goal of matching Mihomo's feature set. `Chimera` follows the `clash-nyanpasu` project, but the key difference is that my top priority is first-class support for the `chimera_client` engine itself, which can largely be considered the `clash-rs` core.
Meanwhile, the `chimera_server` project can be viewed as a Rust implementation of `xray-core`, with compatibility with the original `xray-core` remaining the end goal.
